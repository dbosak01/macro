\title{A Macro Pre-processor for 'R' Programs}
\description{
The \strong{macro} package contains a function to
preprocess R scripts, and output a resolved code file.  Pre-processor
commands are implemented as special comments.
}
\details{
The \strong{macro} package attempts to create a macro language for R that is
similar to the SASÂ® macro language.

There is only one function in the package:
\code{\link{msource}}.  This function acts as a substitute for the Base R
\code{source} function.  The difference is that \code{msource} first runs
a pre-processor to resolve macro statements. The resolved macro statements
are emitted to a separate file.  The \code{msource} function then sources that
file normally.

By default, the pre-processor output is written to a temporary location,
and deleted when the operation is complete.  If desired, you may also
supply a path to save this file to a location of your choosing.
}
\section{Macro Commands}{

Macro commands are implemented as a special form of R comment. The special
comments begin with "#\%".  For example, a macro assignment is written as
\code{#\%let a <- 1}.

Here are the macro features supported by the system:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Macro Comments}: A comment just for macro statements.
\item \strong{Macro Variables}: Initialize macro variables to be used as text replacement tokens.
\item \strong{Macro Conditionals}: Emit code conditionally in pre-processing.
\item \strong{Macro Include}: Insert code from external files into your program.
\item \strong{Macro Functions}: A small number of essential built-in macro functions.
\item \strong{Macro Do Loops}: Emits a block of code repeatedly.
}
The above features give you a simple yet flexible way to perform meta-programming.
In this way, the \strong{macro} package can be useful in several situations,
notably for code generation.

See the \code{\link{msource}} function documentation for additional details.

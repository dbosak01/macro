### Why did you create the macro package? {#motivation}

**Q:** R already has meta-programming capabilities. Why do you want to
create a macro programming capability?


**A:** The **macro** package was motivated specifically for code generation.
The goal is to generate a program where all variable values are resolved, 
and only the desired conditional code is included in the final program. 
This result requires a pre-processing and text replacement capability 
which is lacking in R.  The **macro** package fills that need.

### What capabilities does the macro package provide? {#capabilities}

**Q:** It seems the R macro package provides less features than SAS.
What capabilities does it provide?


**A:** The **macro** package supports the following features:

* Macro Comments
* Macro Variables
* Macro Conditions
* Macro Include
* Macro Do Loops
* User-Defined Macro Functions
* Some Built-In Macro Functions

These features are the most essential features of the SAS macro language,
and will allow you to do most of the things you can do in SAS. There 
are many built-in macro functions in SAS that have not been replicated in the 
**macro** package. The built-in macro functions included in the **macro**
package are `%sysfunc()`, `%symexist()`, and `%symput()`.

### How does the macro package work? {#how}

**Q:** I don't quite get it.  How am I supposed to use this package?

**A:** A macro-enabled R program is a standard R program, with macro
commands added as code comments. These special comments act as pre-processor
directives.  The pre-processor directives are resolved by the pre-processor function
`msource()`. What you will do is write your macro enabled program, and
run it with the `msource()` function instead of the `source()` function.
Normally, you will do this on the command line.  By default, the `msource()`
function will run the currently selected program in RStudio.  Otherwise,
pass the name of the program you want to run as the first parameter on 
`msource()`. The function will pre-process the program, resolve any 
macro statements, and then execute the resolved code.

### Can I create macro functions and do loops? {#functions}

**Q:** I want to create a macro function.  Does the
**macro** package support it? What about do loops?


**A:** Yes. The package supports user-defined macro functions and do loops.
The syntax is similar to SAS.  Note that both of these features are 
text replacement operations. They are useful specifically when you want
to replicate some chunk of code repeatedly. Be mindful of the difference
between these macro capabilities and normal Base R functions and loops, 
and choose your approach appropriately.

### Can I nest macro conditionals? {#nest}

**Q:** I have a complicated set of conditions that are nested
several levels deep. Can I do that with the **macro** package?  

**A:** Yes. The package supports nested conditionals.  There is no
limit on the number of nested levels.

******
### How does %include work? {#include}

**Q:** I see from the documentation there is a "%include" macro function.
How does it work?  Is it the same as SAS?


**A:** Yes. The "#%include" macro function replicates the basic functionality
of SAS "%include".  Text from the included file will be extracted and inserted
into the generated file.  Any macro statements in the included code will be
resolved normally.

******

### How can I use this package to generate code? {#generate}

**Q:** In the documentation you mention that the **macro** package can
be used as a code generator.  How does that work?


**A:** To do code generation, simply supply an output path as the second
parameter on `msource()`.  When the second parameter is not supplied, 
the function will create a temporary output file.  When the second parameter
is supplied, the function will output the resolved code to the specified path.
That file is the generated code.

******

### Why should I use this package for code generation? {#benefits}

**Q:** There are several ways to do code generation in R already.  Why
would I want to use the **macro** package?


**A:** The advantages of using the **macro** package for code generation are:

* It is easy to combine code from several files using the "#%include" command.
* Only the code inside TRUE macro conditions will be emitted to the output file.
This feature makes the resolved code more compact and easier to read.
* Macro variables will be resolved to the actual variable value, instead
of the variable name.  For instance, a macro variable for a file path
will resolve to the actual path, instead of just the variable name. This 
feature also makes the code easier to read and understand.
* You can write your macro program so that the emitted code runs independently,
without any dependencies on external packages, systems, or functions.  This feature
makes the generated code self-contained, portable, and totally transparent.

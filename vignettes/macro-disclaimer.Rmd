The **macro** package should not be used as a substitute for normal R variables and 
conditions.  In general, the R macro facility should be used when in confers
a significant advantage.

The primary scenario **macro** package was written for is code generation. In this
scenario, macro capability allows you to easily produce a resolved code file
that can be saved and run independently.  It is easier to produce such a resolved
program using a macro language than alternative methods.

The other scenario the **macro** package may be useful is for translation of
programs from SAS.  The R macro syntax can be translated quite directly from 
SAS, without having to rethink the logic.

Otherwise, using R macros must be carefully considered. 
Macros can introduce complexity and make your code harder to debug.
Please do not use the **macro** package as an excuse to avoid learning R.
